## Power Loss Summary

### Generic Formulas for Power Loss Calculations

1. **MOSFET Conduction Losses:** \(P_{MOSFET} = I^2 \cdot R_{DS(on)}\)
2. **Resistor Losses:** \(P_{Resistor} = \frac{V^2}{R}\)
3. **Inductor Copper Losses:** \(P_{Inductor} = I^2 \cdot R_{DCR}\)

Where:
- \(I\) is the current through the component,
- \(R_{DS(on)}\) is the on-state resistance of the MOSFET,
- \(V\) is the voltage across the resistor,
- \(R\) is the resistance of the resistor,
- \(R_{DCR}\) is the DC resistance of the inductor.

### Power Loss Calculations for Different Loads

Assuming a 12V nominal input, the losses for 200mA, 500mA, and 1.5A loads are as follows:

- **200mA Load:**
  - \(P_{MOSFET} = 0.2^2 \times 0.02 = 0.0008W\)
  - \(P_{Resistor} = \frac{9.1^2}{100} = 0.8281W\)
  - \(P_{Inductor} = 0.2^2 \times 0.008 = 0.00032W\)
  - **Total Losses:** Approximately 0.8292W

- **500mA Load:**
  - \(P_{MOSFET} = 0.5^2 \times 0.02 = 0.005W\)
  - \(P_{Resistor} = \frac{9.1^2}{100} = 0.8281W\)
  - \(P_{Inductor} = 0.5^2 \times 0.008 = 0.002W\)
  - **Total Losses:** Approximately 0.8351W

- **1.5A Load:**
  - \(P_{MOSFET} = 1.5^2 \times 0.02 = 0.045W\)
  - \(P_{Resistor} = \frac{9.1^2}{100} = 0.8281W\)
  - \(P_{Inductor} = 1.5^2 \times 0.008 = 0.018W\)
  - **Total Losses:** Approximately 0.8911W

### Summary of Power Losses

| Load Current | Total Power Loss (W) |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 200mA        | 0.8292                |
| 500mA        | 0.8351                |
| 1.5A         | 0.8911                |

These calculations indicate the efficiency of the module across different operational scenarios, with minimal losses even at higher loads, ensuring reliability and durability for connected devices.
